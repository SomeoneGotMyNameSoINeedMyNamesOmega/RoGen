TO DO: Set up a Requirements.txt for Aftman to download

BASIC GUIDE:

## Setting Up Aftman

    Download a pre-built binary for your platform from Aftman's GitHub Releases Page [github.com](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).
    Install Aftman by running the following command in your terminal:

`./aftman self-install`bash

This will install Aftman to its own bin directory and update your system's PATH environment variable [github.com](https://github.com/LPGhatguy/aftman).
Using Aftman to Download Lune

    Now that Aftman is installed, you can use it to download Lune. Run the following command in your terminal:

`aftman add filiptibell/lune`bash

This command adds Lune to an ==aftman.toml== file in the current directory or creates one if it does not exist [lune-org.github.io.](https://lune-org.github.io/docs/getting-started/1-installation) Install the tool by running:
`aftman install`bash
This will install all tools listed in ==aftman.toml== files based on your current directory [fig.io.](https://fig.io/manual/aftman/install)

## Installing a Stable Python Version

1. Download and install the latest Python3 installer from the Python Downloads Page [github.com](https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python).
2. During installation, make sure to check the box that adds Python to PATH. It should be labeled something like "Add Python 3.X to PATH" [github.com](https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python)
3. Once Python is installed, you should be able to open a command window, type ==python==, hit ENTER, and see a Python prompt opened. Type ==quit()== to exit it. You should also be able to run the command ==pip== and see its options.
4. If both of these work, then you are ready to go [github.com](https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python)https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python.
